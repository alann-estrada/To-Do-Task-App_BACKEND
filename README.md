# Hello! This is the Backend of the "To Do Task App" application.

It is very necessary for the proper functioning of the application. It may be optional to keep this repository and the frontend one in the same folder for better control.

# Important, to install the project you need nodejs

The installation is done with the command `npm install`

To start the express server you can do it with `yarn dev` which will activate the server, however the following is necessary:

- \*You must have a version of mysql installed, be it applications like `Ampps, Xampp or even Mysql Workbench`
- _The `schema.sql` file must be imported to access test users, tasks, and shared tasks. You can do it directly from the platform console or in phpmyadmin you can import it and see the results_

The comments in the code can be important depending on the case or the errors that may occur during the execution of the project, however they can be removed.

##### A point that may be important is the credentials, they can be used for the process, the api credential could be used `{"x-api-key": "abcdef123456"}` in the header, it is also necessary specify the `application/json`

I hope these points are useful for your development :)
